        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <i>The Lies of Locke Lamora</i> bursts with lavish settings, appealing
            to the senses with descriptions of the sights and smells of bustling
            Camorr. Set in a fantastic world of alchemy and clockwork, it also
            contains accounts of glorious, glorious food. This dish is one of
            four in a given meal when young Locke is first welcomed into the
            fold by the <i>Gentlemen Bastards</i>.

            This is a tasty, if unexpected, pairing. The pears pick up the
            spiciness of the sausage, holding a slight crisp bite in their
            skins. The sausages, on their own, are delicious. However, when
            taken with a bite of the pear, the textures and flavors complement
            one another very nicely. The addition of balsamic tones down the
            oil somewhat, and rounds out all of the flavors brilliantly.

            I recommend it as an Autumnal dish, as the spices and roasting will
            warm both you and your kitchen.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                6 spicy pre-cooked sausages (chorizo, linguica, or hot Italian),
                split in half lengthwise
            </li>
            <li>
                4 firm pears, quarted and cored
            </li>
            <li>
                &half; cup olive oil, plus more for serving
            </li>
            <li>
                &frac14; cup balsamic vinegar, plus more for serving
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drizzle grill pan with 2 Tbsp. olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the sausages and pears in for about 30 seconds on each side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lay the sausages in a pan, add the pears on top, and drizzle
                with the oil and balsamic vinegar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roast in the oven at 450F for about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the sausage and pears to your liking, and serve.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>For an elegant presentation:</em> before plating the
                        sausages and pears, spread an even thin layer of olive
                        oil on the plates. Onto this, carefully let droplets of
                        balsamic vinegar fall onto the plate until fully decorated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
