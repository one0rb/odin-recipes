## Introduction

This is the project from The Odin Project used to test our HTML skills. I'm pretty confident in being able to complete this, but this will be the first time I'm trying to actually use Neovim to build something since I've installed and begun to use it. I'll be trying to build this as semantically as possible and hopefully I'll be able to set up the HTML portion well enough to make it easy to style it with CSS later.
